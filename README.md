# About

A simple game demo where you control the player (a legendary Pok√©mon, Articuno), dodging and destroying enemies in the skies!
Your score is tracked and displayed both during the game and on the GAME OVER screen.
Developed for academic purposes as a project for Applied Programming.

# Feel free to improve and continue developing it!
